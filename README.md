# Techlabs-challenge

This repository contains the data-science part of our Challenge Project in the 2020 [Techlabs](https://www.techlabs.org/) Code at Home bootcamp.

We're building Together Apart - an app to match with friends during COVID-19 lockdown.

In this app, the user will enter their interests and will be matched with other users who they are most likely to get along with.

As a demonstration, we are using an open access dataset aquired from a questionnaire of 1010 young Slovakians. The dataset is called Young People Survey and is available through Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey).

Possible projects:
- Clustering - find natural groupings of people.
- Recommender system - recommend people to eachother based on how many shared interests they have.
- Predicting questionnaire responses based on other questions. Could be useful for if someone only partially fills in the questionnaire.
- Visualisation - What data do we need to visualise and how can we do that best?
